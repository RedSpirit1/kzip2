WE RECCOMMEND YOU DO NOT DELETE THE CHECK_BZIP2 FILE, THIS CHECKS THE FILE FOR ANY BROKEN PACKAGES/GENERAL ERRORS. IT WILL NOT OUTPUT ANY ERRORS IF YOU DELETE THE CHECK_BZIP2 FILE WHICH CAN CONFUSE USERS.

REPORT ANY ERRORS TO ME ON GITHUB.

How to Build:
open the file in terminal
type "make"
if all goes well it should very quickly (since kzip2 is pretty lightweight.) build and make a kzip2 shell that is executable and works.

if kzip2 reports broken packages or anything like that please sent the error message to me on github, it will help with future releases and bug fixes.
